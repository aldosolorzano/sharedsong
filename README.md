(THE GEM 'rspotify' USED TO CONNECT TO THE SPOTIFY API IT'S GIVNG SOME ERRORS, IF YOU FIND A WAY TO FIX IT PLEASE LET ME KNOW)
Shared Song is a web application that allows users to listen to music and share their favourite songs with others utilizing the Spotify API. Using this Shared Song, users are also able to easily track both what has been shared with them, and what they've shared with others.
To improve the search queries, the seed file will populate a table with songs and using elastic search the results will be more accurate, and also show suggestion for the songs.
